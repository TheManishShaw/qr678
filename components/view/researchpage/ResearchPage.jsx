        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-8  mx-auto text-center">
          Male pattern baldness or androgenetic alopecia is a result of the inherent susceptibility of the hair follicles to shrink due to androgen hormones. The hair follicles reduce in size due to hormones and genetic factors in males. Androgenetic Alopecia results in hair thinning and hair loss in a very high number of men and women in their lifetime. In men, androgenetic alopecia causes a receding hairline and gradual disappearance of hair from the crown of the head. In women, androgenetic alopecia or female pattern baldness causes diffuse thinning on the crown of the head, leading to widening parting and thin, frizzy hair that gradually leads to visible scalp.
